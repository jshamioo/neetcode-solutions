Time Boxing Strategy:

15-20 minutes: Initial attempt without hints
5-10 minutes: Look at hints/approach if stuck
10-15 minutes: Implement with hints
Total cap: 45 minutes per problem before moving to solution

The Process:

Read & Understand (2-3 min)

Clarify edge cases, constraints
Think of brute force first


Initial Attempt (15-20 min)

Code the brute force if nothing else comes to mind
Try to optimize while coding
If completely stuck, move to step 3


Hints Phase (5-10 min)

Check NeetCode hints or approach section
Don't look at full solution yet
Try implementing with the hint


Solution Study (10-15 min)

Watch NeetCode explanation
Code along, understand each line
Focus on the "why" behind each step


Solidify (5-10 min)

Code it again from scratch immediately
Add to your notes with key insights



Key Philosophy:

Volume over perfection - seeing 200 problems is better than mastering 50
Pattern recognition - you're building a mental library of approaches
Don't ego-solve - if you're stuck after 20 minutes, you're wasting time that could be spent learning 2-3 more patterns
